# DOSAnalyzer
Calculation and extrapolation of grand canonical density of states to predict continuous thermodynamic observables for adsorption

This script contains the bare bones routines to perform the analyses discussed in DOI: xxxxx . When we have more time we plan to clean it up, add some documentation, make the whole thing more modular, etc. It's very much a work in progress at the moment and probably won't get much more user friendly until we have finished working on some planned functionality increases (since this will probably require a lot of overhaul anyway).
